# python_projects

- This repository will contain most of my personal projects ranging from unit converters, password generators, and contact books up to an overly engineered Tic tac toe game. Most of the projects here are beginner-friendly. This folder will also represent what I have learned throughout my journey with python.

# Here are some of the skills I have learned in my projects, Although small they helped me understand new things about the capabilities of python.
- Defining, calling functions between each other.
- Implementing a win/loss condition
- Score Tracking
- Added a simple single-player and two-player game mode.
- Terminal I/O
- Converting units of measurements
- Adding/Removing contents in a temporary list
- Basing between lists and dictionaries to store and take data from it
- Used tuples as a way to group certain similarities between values
- Able to store the values inputted by the user
- Returned and Stored functions like boxes as a way to use at a later function

- I will be learning more about returning functions, accessing stored data in another file, and start learning classes as a way to expand my knowledge on programming.
